# Web Development Project - Portfolio Wireframe

## Overview
This project contains the wireframe and initial design concepts for Sameer Kaushal's university portfolio website. It focuses on layout, information hierarchy, and basic navigation before adding detailed styling and interactivity.

## Files
- `wireframe.html`: A low-fidelity HTML wireframe demonstrating the layout and structure of the portfolio, including sections for introduction, education, projects, and contact information.

## How to Use
- Download or clone this repository.
- Open `wireframe.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Use the layout as a starting point for implementing the final portfolio with detailed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements
- Add responsive CSS to support mobile and tablet devices.
- Integrate a consistent color scheme, typography, and spacing.
- Implement interactive elements such as project filters or contact form validation.

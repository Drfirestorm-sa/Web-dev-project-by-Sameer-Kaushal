## Band 1 – Pass Requirements

These are the minimum technical standards you must meet. Completing all items in this band demonstrates that you can build, structure, and deploy a functional front-end website using the technologies taught in the module. If any item is missing, the coursework receives a Fail.

| Requirement | Description of Requirement | Evidence (How You Met This Requirement) |
|---|---|---|
| **Semantic HTML** | The site uses correct HTML5 semantic elements with a logical heading structure. | Every page uses `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang="en">`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>`). For example, `index.html` has a single `<h1>` in the hero section followed by `<h2>` section titles ("Featured Projects") and `<h3>` for individual cards. `<meta charset>` and `<meta name="viewport">` are present on all pages. Semantic elements like `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<a>` are used in navigation. |
| **Three-Page Website** | Includes at minimum: Home, About, Portfolio. Pages are linked via navigation. | The site contains **six pages**: Home (`index.html`), About (`about.html`), Projects/Portfolio (`projects.html`), Skills (`skills.html`), Contact (`contact.html`), and Fravara Case Study (`fravara-case-study.html`). All pages share a consistent Bootstrap navbar with links to Home, About, Projects, Evidence, Reflection, Skills, and Contact. |
| **Responsive Design** | Layout adapts correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Navigation remains usable. | The site uses Bootstrap 5's responsive grid system (`col-lg-6`, `col-md-4`, `col-6`, etc.) and includes `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` on every page. Custom CSS defines four media query breakpoints at `1199px`, `991px`, `767px`, and `575px` to adjust profile image sizes, hero text, button layout, timeline spacing, and more. The navbar collapses into a toggler on smaller screens via Bootstrap's `navbar-expand-lg` and `navbar-toggler`. |
| **CSS / CSS Library Use** | Uses CSS and/or a CSS library (e.g., Bootstrap) to structure and style the site. | Bootstrap 5.3.3 is loaded via CDN on every page (`bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css`). A custom `style.css` file (1,800 lines) provides a full design system with CSS custom properties (design tokens), dark mode theming, custom animations, glassmorphism effects, a custom scrollbar, page loader, custom cursor, and refined component styles. |
| **Extensible Portfolio Page** | Portfolio items are presented in a repeatable structure that allows easy future additions. | The Projects page (`projects.html`) uses a repeatable Bootstrap card structure inside a grid (`col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4`). Each project follows the same pattern: a `<div class="card h-100 project-card">` containing an image, title (`<h3>`), description, skill badges, and optional action buttons. Adding a new project requires duplicating this card block and updating the content — no structural changes needed. |
| **Basic GitHub Usage** | The site code is hosted in a GitHub repository with at least a small number of meaningful commits (not a single upload). | The repository is hosted at `https://github.com/Drfirestorm-sa/Web-dev-project-by-Sameer-Kaushal`. The commit history shows **11 meaningful commits** with descriptive messages such as: "Add initial HTML and CSS files for portfolio website", "feat: implement dark mode toggle and back-to-top button across all pages", "Add Fravara case study page", and "Refactor code structure for improved readability and maintainability". |
| **Deployment** | The website is deployed publicly (e.g. GitHub Pages). The link works. | *(To be completed once deployed — enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings and paste the live URL above.)* |
| **Code Quality** | HTML validates with no critical errors. Code is well-structured and organised. | All HTML pages use valid `<!DOCTYPE html>` declarations, include required `<meta>` tags, properly close all elements, and use correct nesting. The CSS file is well-organised with clearly labelled sections (Design Tokens, Dark Mode, Typography, Navbar, Hero, Cards, etc.). JavaScript is cleanly structured with commented sections for each feature (page loader, cursor, dark mode, scroll progress, animations, form validation). |

## Band 2 – Development Checks

These requirements allow you to stretch your skills and confirm that you can apply web technologies beyond the basics. They are not required for a Pass, but they help you evaluate your own capability and demonstrate a deeper understanding of front-end development. Use this band to challenge yourself.

| Requirement | Description of Requirement | Evidence (How You Met This Requirement) |
|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap Components** | Uses at least one Bootstrap component (e.g., cards, navbars, grid). | Multiple Bootstrap components are used throughout the site: **Navbar** (`navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top` with collapse/toggler), **Cards** (`card h-100 project-card` for projects and skills), **Grid system** (`row`, `col-md-4`, `col-lg-6`, etc.), **Buttons** (`btn btn-primary btn-lg`, `btn-outline-light`), **Badges** (`badge bg-primary` for skill tags), **Progress bars** (on Skills page for proficiency ratings), **Form controls** (`form-floating`, `form-control`) on the Contact page, and **Alerts** (`alert alert-success` for form feedback). |
| **Typography Improvements** | Uses Google Fonts or styling utilities to improve text presentation. | Three Google Fonts are imported: **Inter** (body text — weights 300–800), **Space Grotesk** (display headings), and **JetBrains Mono** (monospace/code). These are defined as CSS custom properties (`--font-body`, `--font-display`, `--font-mono`) for consistent usage. Font preconnect tags (`fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`) are included in every page `<head>` for performance. |
| **Refined Layout Control** | Makes effective use of spacing, alignment, and utility classes. | Bootstrap utility classes are used extensively: spacing (`mb-3`, `mt-5`, `py-5`, `px-4`), alignment (`text-center`, `text-md-end`, `align-items-center`, `ms-auto`), display (`d-flex`, `d-inline-block`, `d-none`), sizing (`w-100`, `h-100`), and visual helpers (`shadow-sm`, `rounded`, `border`, `opacity-25`). Custom CSS design tokens define consistent spacing (`--section-padding: 7rem`) and border radius values (`--radius-sm` through `--radius-full`). |
| **Consistent Component Design** | Portfolio items use a uniform structure (cards, repeated blocks, etc.). | All seven project items on the Projects page use identical card markup: `<div class="card h-100 project-card">` with `card-img-top`, `card-body`, `card-title`, `card-text`, and `skill-tags` badge container. The Skills page similarly uses repeated `skill-card` and `other-skill-card` components. Evidence items also follow a uniform `evidence-card` pattern. |
| **Improved GitHub Practice** | Commits are regular and meaningful (not just "final version"), showing incremental development. | The repository contains 11 commits with progressive, descriptive messages following conventional commit style: "feat: add initial portfolio website with interactive components", "docs: improve README with usage instructions", "feat: implement dark mode toggle and back-to-top button across all pages", "chore: remove fravara-case-study.html file", "Add Fravara case study page detailing AI-powered smart glasses", and "Refactor code structure for improved readability and maintainability". This shows clear incremental development. |
| **HTML Validation** | HTML fully validated using tools such as W3C, with warnings addressed. | All pages use valid HTML5 structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `lang` attribute, proper `<meta>` tags, and correct element nesting. Accessibility attributes such as `title` on buttons (e.g., "Toggle navigation", "Back to top", "Toggle dark mode"), `alt` text on all images, `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax` on progress bars, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links, and `novalidate` with custom validation on forms are present. *(Recommend running W3C Validator to confirm zero errors and document the result.)* |

## Band 3 – Industry Readiness

These requirements reflect practices and expectations found in real front-end roles. Meeting them demonstrates professionalism, technical maturity, and readiness to work with modern development conventions and tools. These items are optional but strongly encouraged for students aiming to build a public-facing portfolio or apply for internships.

| Requirement | Description of Requirement | Evidence (How You Met This Requirement) |
|---|---|---|
| **Component Customisation** | Bootstrap components or CSS utilities customised beyond defaults. | Bootstrap is heavily customised via a 1,800-line `style.css` with CSS custom properties overriding Bootstrap defaults. Custom design tokens redefine the colour palette (`--primary: #2563eb`), card shadows, border radii, and transitions. The navbar uses glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`) instead of Bootstrap's default solid background. Cards have custom hover transforms (`translateY(-8px)`) and gradient borders. A full dark mode theme overrides all colour variables. Custom components like the page loader, scroll progress bar, animated cursor, and typing effect go well beyond Bootstrap defaults. |
| **Fine-Grained Responsiveness** | Uses breakpoints intentionally to adjust layout across device sizes. | Four distinct breakpoints are defined in CSS: **1199px** (large desktop — adjusts profile image to 280px), **991px** (tablet — collapses navbar into glassmorphic dropdown, centres hero text, adjusts buttons, hides custom cursor, reduces section padding), **767px** (small tablet — reduces stat font sizes, shrinks profile image, adjusts timeline padding, hides scroll indicator), **575px** (mobile — reduces hero heading to 2.2rem, makes buttons full-width, adjusts form padding, further shrinks profile image). A print media query also hides non-essential UI elements. |
| **Additional Front-End Library** | Includes a library such as FontAwesome, Animate.css, or similar. | **Font Awesome 6.4.0** is loaded via CDN (`cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css`) on every page. It is used extensively for: navigation icons, skill section icons (`fa-code`, `fa-brain`, `fa-tools`), contact method icons (`fa-envelope`, `fa-linkedin`, `fa-github`), button icons (`fa-rocket`, `fa-arrow-right`, `fa-paper-plane`), interest section icons (`fa-glasses`, `fa-shield-alt`, `fa-users`), and social media links in the footer. |
| **Professional Git Workflow** | Uses branching, meaningful commit messages, and merges following a simple Git flow. | The repository uses two branches: `main` (production/initial) and `test` (development). Feature development was done on the `test` branch with 10 incremental commits before merging. Commit messages follow conventional commit conventions (e.g., `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) indicating an understanding of professional Git practices. |
| **Performance Awareness** | Runs Lighthouse or similar checks and implements improvements. | Performance-conscious decisions include: Google Fonts preconnect links (`rel="preconnect"`) for faster font loading, CDN-hosted libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome) for caching benefits, CSS custom properties for efficient theming without duplication, `loading` optimization through a page loader with fallback timeout, `will-change` and `transform` used for GPU-accelerated animations, and a print stylesheet that strips non-essential elements. *(Recommend running a Lighthouse audit and documenting the scores.)* |
| **Clean Project Structure** | Folders and files organised to industry norms (assets, css, js, images). | The project currently keeps all files in the root directory (`index.html`, `about.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, images). While functional, this could be improved by organising assets into subdirectories (e.g., `css/`, `js/`, `images/`) to better follow industry conventions. *(Consider restructuring into folders for a cleaner project layout.)* |
